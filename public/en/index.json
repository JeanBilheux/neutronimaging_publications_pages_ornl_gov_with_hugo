To submit your proposal, go to the proposal system. \n This site is designed to help you with the preparation of your experiment and subsequent data processing and analysis. If you are not familiar with neutron imaging and may be interested in collaborating with us, visit the publications page to review the science we do.\nFor industrial applications, please contact Hassina Bilheux\nWe recommend that you discuss your experiment with the instrument team as soon as you receive approval of your beam time.\n Main features  Prepare your venue: Everything you will need to do before coming to our laboratory. Capabilities: list of imaging instruments available. How to: short tutorials such as how to access your data, connect to the computers, etc. Frequently Asked Questions: answers to the most frequent questions we got from our users. Links: handy links.
